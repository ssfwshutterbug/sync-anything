# sync-anything

I like anything-sync-daemon(https://github.com/graysky2/anything-sync-daemon) 
which is called asd, it can be install in archlinux since archlinux uses 
systemd, and asd only supports systemd. But i use gentoo with oprc, so i 
cannot install asd in my linux. Yeah, in a fact, there is no need to rewrite
the script, the only thing need to do is change service to openrc's init. But 
i'd like to rewrite it, make it simple and more bugs. Any way, who cares!
